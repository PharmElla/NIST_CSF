## Following the guideline outlined by the NIST Cybersecurity Framework:

- Identify security risks through regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential gaps in security. 

- Protect internal assets through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats. 

- Detect potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections. 

- Respond to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents; implement improvements to the security process. 

- Recover affected systems to normal operation and restore systems data and/or assets that have been affected by an incident.
